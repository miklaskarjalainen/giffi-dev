Hi, Iâ€™m a 19y computer science student from finland.

I've interests in game making, automatisation and working with low level hardware/frameworks.
I've been learning c++/c, godot and python for about 2 years now, and almost nothing to show for it.

**The easiest** way to reach me is through Discord: Giffi#0001.
