Hi, Iâ€™m a 19y computer science student from finland.

I've interests in game making, automatisation and working with low level hardware/frameworks.
I have a working knowledge of GodotEngine, Rust, C++ and C.
I also know JavaScript/TypeScript and Nim, but at a lower proficiency.

**The easiest** way to reach me is through Discord: Giffi#0001.
